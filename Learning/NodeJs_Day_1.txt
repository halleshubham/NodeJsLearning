Stick to Js = NO. why ?
Cause - Challenges of implementation.
	Browser incompatibility issues to be resolved.
	Not strongly typed. It scales badly.

Js -	Many libraries - JQuery etc. - specific purpose, everywhere, 
	Some frameworks - Angular, React,
	All designed for UI development.
	But eversince, NodeJs came to market, industry has taken Js devs to server / Backend development.
Disadv- loosely typed, no modularity.. Hence Ts



NodeJS- saves life and time - Combination of Js nd C++, unix etc.
	"Node JS is designed for highly concurrent and complex servers."
	Node JS - 6 is industry standard. Most recent and stable - 8.9 and recentest is 9.2

npm- 	Node Package Manager - libraries and packages, global directory for many of dependencies.

Install node, install npm.


Node Js- The server-side Javascript. A platform.

	V8 is an opens source javascript engine, by google. Chrome uses v8 engine for js. by Ryan Dahl in 2009. Latest version is 4.1.0.
	Paypal - developed system on Node Js.
	40% js and 60% c++. Compiles Js to native machine code.v8 is extremely fast.
	Event driven, non blocking. Single Thread - controversial and interesting.
	Single thread - but highly scalable, No buffering.

	Can develop - HTTP server, DNS server, Static File Transfer, Web chat apps, real time games.
	

	Single Thread - Synchronous IO.
	Multiple Thread - Synchronous IO.
	

	TOmcat blindly creates number of threads for number of connections. (single threaded). irrespective of whether they are blocking or non blocking.

	Comparison of NodeJs and Tomcat. Architecture, event loop, non blocking IO tasks.

This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help json` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Babel - most famous transpiler - Convert typescript/ES6 into javascript.

Typescript is build on top of ES6. Ts is far more better than js. Babel & TypeScript are same kind of transpillers. Industry safe = version 2 and below.

1. back tild ` asd
asda` (multiple lines in Js.)

2. String interpolation: console.log('Hello ${person.name}! your age is${}')  ==> consolel.log('Hello" + person.name + " "..);

3. Function parameter (default).

4. Expression binding. ${}

5. let a = 2, scope declarations

6. Classes support
